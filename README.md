<h1>MingleNet: A Novel Dual Stacking Approach for Medical Image Segmentation</h1>
Medical image segmentation is important for disease diagnosis and treatment planning. 
</br>
Ensemble learning, which combines multiple models or predictions, can improve accuracy and performance in medical image segmentation. We propose MingleNet, which uses multiple layers of ensemble learning. 
</br>
MingleNet uses double-stacking of models, such as DoubleU-Net, DeepLabv3+, U-Net, and DeepLab, to produce masks.
